## Description

AGR ANALYSIS is project in which  we are working on a customer transaction dataset by using Apache Spark, which is a data processing framework that can quickly perform
processing tasks on very large data sets, and can also distribute data processing tasks across multiple computers, either on its own or in tandem with other distributed computing
tools. Using these datasets and Spark SQL we have created various use cases pertaining to real life scenarios in banking.We have used azure databricks as an platform to work with 
our available data.We have used various services of azure databricks to get insights from the avialble dataset.In this project we have used azure devops services for continuous integration
